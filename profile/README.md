# ZeltLabs

**ZeltLabs** is an open-source innovation studio that develops software in focused, independent cycles.

Each product is built by a dedicated team and consists of two parts: a practical, open-source tool and a published research paper documenting the process from problem analysis to implementation.

---

## How We Work

- One Zelt Account gives access to all products  
- All software is open source, with optional pro features or paid support  
- Each project is paired with a transparent research paper  
- Teams are independent and product-specific  
- Zelt always contributes resources and holds partial ownership of the product
- Everything we do is open and documented

**ZeltLabs builds tools for the world â€” open, practical, research-driven, and endlessly curious.**
